</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Once upon a time there was a very
bad King who ruled over a very
good country.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a good country because the
land was rich, and things grew well,
and because the people worked hard
and were thrifty and intelligent. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>King was bad because he was terribly
extravagant, because he spent fortunes
upon fortunes on pleasure, because he
gambled all the money in his mint
away, and, with all this fearful spending,
he never thought of giving anything
to the poor. He was a very
bad King indeed, just the meanest,
poorest thing in kings that ever sat
upon a throne!</p>

<p class='c006'>When the King’s pockets were
empty, and the treasury chest and
mint were also empty, the only thing
His Majesty could do was to increase
the taxes. This he did on an
average about every other fortnight,
and the consequence was that his
thrifty, hard-working people had to
give all their money to pay the King’s
debts. This the people did not in the
least like doing, and the King was
very unpopular indeed; in fact, matters
went to such a pitch that his subjects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>would not bow to him when they met
him in the streets of his capital.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the King did not seem to mind
this one bit; he continued his extravagances
and his wicked gambling, he
cleared out the treasury chest more
often than ever, and he taxed the people
harder and harder every day.</p>

<p class='c006'>But everything must come to an
end sooner or later, you know, and it
really seemed as if the end of that
country had almost arrived, for the
people began to starve, and such things
as fires were only known in the houses
of the richest. But the King borrowed
money on his crown, sceptre, and family
jewels, and went on anyhow, as usual.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it so happened that there lived
in a suburb of the King’s city a very
beautiful girl, whose name was Ellaleen.
She lived in a nice house with her
father and mother and brothers and
sisters, and it was altogether a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>nice family. Not only was it a good-looking,
well-behaved family, but it
was also a very healthy one, and had
a very healthy appetite, which is perhaps
a drawback when there is next
to nothing to eat.</p>

<p class='c006'>Well, Ellaleen took matters very
much to heart. She objected to growing
thinner every day, and it made
her more miserable than she could
express to see her father and her
mother and her brothers and sisters
all growing thinner, while each one
pretended that he or she was not a
bit hungry, so that others could have
more. It made her wretched to see
her suffering neighbours, and the poor
peasants who soon became too sickly
to work; and, indeed, what was the
use of working when all the profits
were taken away? Ellaleen felt as if
she would have given her life to save
her country!</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Now this beautiful and tenderhearted
girl had a dream one night,
a strange dream, because it was so
wonderfully vivid.</p>

<p class='c006'>She dreamt that a funny old woman,
all dressed in red, came to her bedside,
and said in a clear voice:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ellaleen, if thou wilt journey alone
to the willow copse, on the south side
of the Blue Mountain that lies to the
south of the city, thou shalt there find
the means to save thy country.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This sentence the little old woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>repeated three times, and Ellaleen,
when she woke in the morning, felt
like a second Joan of Arc, for, of
course, you know that Joan of Arc
was told in a dream that she was to
save her country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellaleen did not wait for breakfast—not
that it would have made the
least difference if she had, for there
was no breakfast to wait for (the
King’s-taxes had called the day before)—but
having obtained permission
from her father and mother, whom
she had told about her dream, she
started off for the willow copse on
the south side of the Blue Mountain.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was late by the time she arrived
there—quite dusk, in fact—and it was
very much further than she expected.
As she entered the copse her heart beat
high with excitement, for there, on a
fallen tree, sat the old woman of her
dream. As soon as the old woman
saw her she rose and came quickly
forward.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
<img src='images/illus011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>“<span class='sc'>On a Fallen Tree sat the Old Woman of her Dream.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Ellaleen, I am glad thou hast
come,” she said in a kindly voice, and
taking the girl by her hands; “and
art thou prepared to suffer much to
save the people from their fearful
affliction?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed, indeed I am,” replied
Ellaleen with all her heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then come with me,” said the little
old woman, and she led the way to the
edge of the copse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See, there is the Yellow Mountain,”
she continued, pointing south.</p>

<p class='c006'>They could not help seeing the Yellow
Mountain, for the setting sun reflected
its glory upon it and made it shine like
red and liquid gold.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thou must travel there through the
night,” went on the little old woman.
“After the sun has set, the moon will
rise and shine upon the mountain, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>it will be no longer yellow, but like
molten silver; and when thou hast
arrived at the mountain, which will be
about dawn, thou wilt climb its steeps
and descend the other side to fields upon
fields of nettles. And when thou hast
come to the fields of nettles, thou must
take off thy shoes and stockings, and
bare thine arms, and then thou must
pluck the longest nettles at the root,
and with them make seven plaits, each
plait two yards long. And all the time
thou workest thou must not grumble,
but sing cheerily, although thou art
ready to cry out with pain and fatigue.
Thinkest thou, Ellaleen, that thou canst
do all this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I will try,” answered the girl.
“And when I have made the seven
plaits, what am I to do with them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thou art to return the way thou
wentest, bare-footed and bare-armed,
bringing with thee the seven plaits of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>nettles. And when thou art come to
the lake on the top of the mountain,
the lake that supplies the country, thou
art to throw the plaits one by one
into the water; and having done so,
thou art to return home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And then?” asked Ellaleen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And then thou must wait and see
what will happen,” replied the little old
woman. “And now, Ellaleen, thou
must set out on thy hard task, and thou
hast indeed my blessing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>With that the old woman left the
girl, with the shadow of evening falling
on her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellaleen did as she had been told.
She journeyed to the Yellow Mountain,
which shone in the moonlight like a
pillar of burnished silver, and she
arrived at its summit as the day dawned.
Then she descended the other side, and
soon came to the fields of nettles.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
<img src='images/illus015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>“<span class='sc'>Nobody had ever known such Nettles before.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Such nettles! such fearful nettles!
with prickles as large as needles. But
Ellaleen did not hesitate, she took off
her shoes and stockings, and bared her
white arms, and singing, stepped into
the mass of horrid weeds.</p>

<p class='c006'>How loudly she sang! If she had not
done so she must have cried out in
agony, for the cruel nettles tore her
poor arms and legs and feet. She had
never known such nettles as these;
nobody had ever known such nettles as
these! She thought that she must
really give up in despair, but she did
not. She sang on, and she worked
on, and she gathered those nettles near
the roots, and wove them, with her poor
hands, into seven plaits. Then wearily
and slowly, but indeed happily, she
went back the way she came, and to the
Blue Mountain, and to the lake on
its summit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ellaleen threw the plaits of nettles
one by one into the lake, and as each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>one touched the water great waves
arose, and there were sounds like peals
of terrific thunder. As the last rumble
died away, Ellaleen turned her back
upon the lake, and dragged her poor
body home and waited to see what was
going to happen next.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c006'>“Dear me, isn’t it wonderful? isn’t
it delicious?” everybody exclaimed.
Then everybody had some more.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the water they were talking
about. It had suddenly acquired the
most exquisite flavour. Everybody, including
the King, drank it, and nothing
else. Even at the village inn, water
was asked for, and only water. It was
really more than marvellous.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then something still more marvellous
happened.</p>

<p class='c006'>Everybody began to feel very
drowsy, and before twenty-four hours
had passed everybody fell fast asleep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>not only every living soul in the
country, but every animal, just as in
the Sleeping Beauty story.</p>

<p class='c006'>And they slept on and on and on,
during the spring, the summer, autumn,
and the winter, through another spring
and through another summer. And
while they slept there appeared to
everyone in Dreamland a little old
woman dressed in red, who told them
what Ellaleen had done, and how she
suffered for her country’s good.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then everybody woke up suddenly,
and rubbing their eyes, stared at each
other and the country. The country
was worth staring at. Never before
had been seen such harvest fields with
their rich golden corn; never before
had the fruit trees borne such splendid
fruit. The vineyards were heavy with
grapes; and every garden, palace
garden and cottage garden, was filled
with magnificent vegetables and beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>flowers. The country was as rich
as it possibly could be.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>And the King? Well, the King had
his sleep and his dream as well as the
others, and when he woke up and
rubbed his eyes he was not a bit like
the same King.</p>

<p class='c006'>He called his courtiers and his people
together, and in their presence he
journeyed to the Blue Mountain and
thence to the Yellow Mountain, and he
climbed its steeps and descended to the
other side. And when he came to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>fields of nettles he took off his shoes
and stockings and bared his hands, and
then he stepped into the cruel weeds,
singing all the time.</p>

<p class='c006'>And he made not seven plaits but
seventy, and he could make no more
because he was exhausted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thus,” he said to his people, “do I
try to punish myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From that day forth he turned into a
good king, and taxed his people only
justly. And by degrees he paid off his
debts and got back his crown and
sceptre and family jewels, and so was
respectable and presentable once more.</p>

<p class='c006'>And the water in the lake? Well, it
turned again into ordinary water. And
Ellaleen? I suppose you think she
married the King and lived happily
ever after; but she did nothing of the
sort.</p>

<div>
  <h2 id='Our' class='c004'>WHEN OUR SHIP COMES HOME.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Dear, dear me, how very silly of me
to fall asleep. Whatever shall I
do? there is no knowing what may
happen, it is really too terrible to think
about.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The speaker was a fish. In the
ordinary way fishes don’t talk much,
but this happened to be a fairy fish, and
fairy fishes can do most things. Most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>things, but not all things, otherwise
this particular little fairy fish would not
have been in such trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>The facts are simply these. The
little fish had fallen asleep, and the tide
having gone out, had left it in a very
tiny pool of water on the seashore. The
pool of water was so small that it ran
the risk of being dried up by the sun,
and that would be truly awful for the
little fish, for if the water dried up it
would die.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now what made matters even worse
was that this little fairy fish was in
reality a beautiful mermaid—a beautiful
mermaid with hair like the golden sands,
eyes as blue as the sea, and lips as red
as coral. But this was in her own
country, some miles away in the rolling
ocean. In her own country, too, she
had the wonderful power of being able
to change her shape. The pretty mermaid
could become a sole, or a lobster,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>or an oyster, but unfortunately she had
not this power out of her own country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the mermaid had changed herself
into a little Red Mullet, and, as we have
just said, had fallen asleep and had been
caught in a tiny pool of water on the
seashore. Poor little thing, it could
not change back again, and so was a
prisoner.</p>

<p class='c006'>But worse was to happen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Etty, here is a dear little fish;
let us take it home and cook it for
mother’s supper,” said a little voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The little voice belonged to a little girl
who was talking to another little girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Red Mullet trembled and grew
pale. Enough to make it! Fancy
hearing some one talking about eating
one for supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes, do let’s,” said the other
little girl, as they both peered into the
pool. “Mother will be pleased; but
how shall we carry it?”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“Oh, anyhow, pick it up in your
fingers, Etty,” replied the first little girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Red Mullet shivered, and quivered
its tail, and turned even paler; it was
losing its colour altogether, and that’s a
serious matter for a Red Mullet!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I don’t know,” said Etty,
thoughtfully, “poor little thing, perhaps
it has a father and mother, and brothers
and sisters in the sea, it seems a pity to
eat it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Red Mullet buried its nose in
the sand, and blew little bubbles to the
surface of the water. It was very much
excited indeed!</p>

<p class='c006'>“But it will die here I should think,”
said the other little girl; “let us throw
it into the sea so that it can go back to
its father and mother, and brothers and
sisters, if it likes. Pick it up, Etty,
and throw it into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Etty did not quite like touching the
cold little fish, nevertheless she did, and
threw it into the sea that came rippling
up in tiny waves to her feet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
<img src='images/illus027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>“<span class='sc'>Poor little Thing, perhaps it has a Father and Mother.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The Red Mullet remained quite quiet
for a second or two, the shock had been
so great, and then it darted away to its
home in the ocean.</p>

<p class='c006'>Etty and her sister went home too.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c006'>Sorrow was in the land; great sorrow,
for there were poverty and sickness in
nearly every house. Everything had
gone wrong in that country for some
time, and somehow things could not get
right again; it was such a pity!</p>

<p class='c006'>Etty and her sister walked hand in
hand and bare-footed on the seashore,
and it was nearly a year since they had
let the Red Mullet free. The two little
girls were looking out for <i>that</i> ship which
never would come. Mother had told
them that everything would come right
when their ship came home, but it was
such a long time coming. They began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to fear that it had gone down to the
bottom of the sea, and that things would
never come right.</p>

<p class='c006'>And what was to happen to them all?
It was so hard to live, so very hard;
food was so scarce and the hospitals
were full to overflowing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder,” said Etty suddenly,
looking up into her sister’s face, “I
wonder where that little pink fish is,
that we found last year.” Wonder,
indeed they would have wondered, if
they could have seen the little pink fish
at that moment. The Red Mullet, no
longer a Red Mullet, but a beautiful
mermaid, was under the waves only a
few yards from the two children. In
her hands she carried a strange-looking
casket, which she brought nearer and
nearer to the shore; then she gave it
in charge of a friendly wave that washed
it almost to the children’s naked feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What can it be?” they said, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>that is exactly what you would have said
under the same circumstances. Then
they pulled it to land and tried to
open it. It was not very difficult and
they soon succeeded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Etty, what lovely beads!” said
one little girl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lovely beads!” repeated Etty;
“let’s take some home to mother.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They took a handful each of the contents
of the casket, and, burying the
casket in the sand, went home.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they started off they both turned
and listened for a moment. “I thought
I heard a lovely laugh,” said Etty.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had; it was the laughter of the
mermaid, the happy, merry laughter of
the sea fairy, who was pleased to see her
present had been received. They gave
the beads to mother, who started when
she saw them. They showed them to
their father, who gave a great cry and
sprang to his feet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
<img src='images/illus031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Why do you do that?” said Etty,
in much surprise. And her sister
wondered also; what did it mean?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mean, my dears,” answered their
father in a choking voice, “it means
that our ship has at last come home.
These are not beads but pearls.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have plenty more of them,”
said the children.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their father put on his hat and went
out. They came back shortly with the
casket and all the pearls, and they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><i>such</i> lovely pearls; indeed, that was not
very wonderful, for the Red Mullet had
taken a world of trouble to find the
most beautiful pearls in the ocean and
had been quite successful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, the children’s parents were by
no means greedy people, they shared
the fairy’s gifts with their neighbours,
with the happy consequence that where
sorrow and sickness had been, happiness
and health were in their stead.</p>

<p class='c006'>And that is just as it should be, isn’t
it? And what is the moral of this little
tale? Be kind to all living creatures,
even down to a tiny Red Mullet, and
there is no knowing what may happen;
perhaps <i>your</i> ship will come home,
sooner than you expect, if you earn a
mermaid’s gratitude.</p>

  <h2 id='Golden' class='c004'>THE GOLDEN WISH.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Lady Elizabeth was really a
very nice girl. She was affectionate,
and generous and distinctly
clever. Lady Elizabeth was also pretty,
and of course that goes a very long
way; but for all that Lady Elizabeth
was not happy, for the very simple
reason that she was not contented.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The fact was that her father, the
Earl, had lost a lot of money, and as
earls go, he was poor, and the consequence
was that Lady Elizabeth had to
put up with a great deal that she did
not like, and do a great many things
that she did not care to do. She
grumbled at having to perform the
household duties, she grumbled at the
servants, and grumbled because she had
to go out and do the shopping and
marketing herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>From morning till evening she sighed
for riches, and even if she woke up in
the middle of the night, her thoughts
turned to gold; and when thoughts
continually turn to gold it is very bad
for them, and is sure to make the
thinker discontented and wretched.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it was through always having
the same longing, morning, noon, and
night, that a very strange and terrible
thing happened to Lady Elizabeth; one
of the most wonderful and awkward,
things that could happen to anybody.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
<img src='images/illus035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>“<span class='sc'>She had to perform many Household Duties.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>To begin with, I must tell you that
there is in the sea a shoal of magic
fishes. Some people say that there were
originally in the shoal ten thousand fish,
other people put the number down at
only seven thousand five hundred, but
that really doesn’t matter much; but
what does matter to the story is this,
that Lady Elizabeth bought one of
these magic fishes in the market, and
eat it that same night for her supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not that she knew that the fish she
had eaten was anything out of the way.
In fact, nobody knew this, neither the
cook, nor the fishmonger from whom it
was purchased, nor anybody else; but
eat it Lady Elizabeth did and had to
take the consequences.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear me!” she exclaimed, after
supper, trying to keep her heavy eyes
open, “I feel ever so sleepy.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Better go to bed,” said the Earl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think I will,” replied Lady Elizabeth,
with a little yawn, and giving her
father a kiss, she went upstairs to her
bedroom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, dear,” she exclaimed, as she
proceeded to undress herself, “what an
unfortunate girl I am. Fancy an earl’s
daughter having no maid to help her to
bed when she is sleepy. Bah!” and
here she stamped her little foot, “I
wish everything were gold, that I could
sell it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Having made this foolish remark, she
was naughty enough to break the strings
of her petticoat, for they had become
knotted. Then she jumped into bed,
and before her pretty head had touched
the white pillow she was fast asleep,
beyond even the land of dreams.</p>

<p class='c006'>She slept soundly all the night
through, not waking up till the sun
was shining in at her window, in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>his golden glory; indeed it was a
glorious day, golden, bright, and beautiful!</p>

<p class='c006'>Lady Elizabeth jumped from her bed
with a song on her lips, and her eyes
bright with health and beauty. But of
a sudden the song ceased, as she cried
out in wonder and alarm, and her eyes
became fixed with extraordinary astonishment.
She had poured the water
from the jug into the basin, and as soon
as she touched it with her pink fingers
it had frozen hard. Frozen quite solid,
not into ice, but into pure gold. Pure
gold, worth hundreds of pounds!</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the same in the bath, a bath
both deep and wide. As soon as her
little pink toe touched the water it
froze into a large block of yellow gold,
worth thousands upon thousands of
pounds.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Lady Elizabeth Buys the Magic Fish.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>She was so bewildered, so excited, so
delighted that she could hardly dress
herself, but she managed to do so somehow,
and then ran downstairs to tell
her father the good news. He was a
rich man now, and could have servants,
and horses and carriages and everything
else that he desired!</p>

<p class='c006'>Lady Elizabeth and the Earl gloated
over the gold, and the household came
and stared at it in mute wonder. More
water was poured into the bath and the
same thing happened as before; when
touched by Lady Elizabeth’s fair fingers
it turned into the precious metal. But
wonder must give way to other feelings.
The Earl’s daughter began to
feel hungry, very hungry in fact, for
she had a good appetite and it was
long past breakfast-time; she had had
nothing to eat since her supper of Magic
Fish the night before.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was a nice breakfast, coffee and
rolls, fresh butter and eggs, and jams
and other nice things. Lady Elizabeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>said her grace, sat down, poured herself
out a cup of coffee and raised it to her
rosy lips.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lady Elizabeth let the cup fall with
a crash, breaking it to atoms, as she
sprang to her feet with a scream, while
the Earl fell off his chair in amazement.
He was an elderly earl, and rather
nervous, and sudden shocks upset him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus041.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>But really it was enough to upset
anybody, for as soon as his daughter’s
lips touched the coffee it had turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>into solid gold. No wonder she dropped
the cup, it was so heavy.</p>

<p class='c006'>She tried a second cup with the same
result; then, with trembling fingers,
she touched the loaf of bread, when it
turned to gold immediately; eggs, jam,
butter, even the very crumbs turned
into golden nuggets, and as Lady Elizabeth
found it impossible to eat gold,
she went without any breakfast whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her father was much concerned.
Magicians were sent for from all over
the country, but they could do nothing
but stare with wonder and help themselves
to the golden eggs to pay for
their travelling expenses.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The same thing happened at luncheon,
at dinner, tea and supper. Lady Elizabeth
was starving. In the evening
another remarkable event took place.
She happened to touch the pet poodle,
when it immediately became a golden
dog. The Earl, at this, became more
nervous than ever, and shrieked whenever
his daughter came near him. The
servants shunned her, too, fearful of
the consequences of touching her. Poor
Elizabeth; a more unhappy girl did
not go to bed that night! But she had
eaten the Magic Fish and wished for
gold, and her wish had been fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same happened the next day.
Crowds of people came from far and
near to see the wonder of the age, and
while they wondered, Lady Elizabeth
was slowly starving to death.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” she cried, “if only I could
be like an ordinary girl again. I vow
I would never be discontented any
more. I would do my best to be cheerful
and never, never grumble again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As she made this vow there came a
peal of thunder, and of a sudden the
golden water, the golden bread, jam,
butter, and even the eggs the Magicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>had taken for their travelling expenses,
turned back into their natural state.
And to the joy of Lady Elizabeth,
her father, and the people who loved
her, she once more could work, eat, and
drink again.</p>

<p class='c006'>From that day to this she was never
discontented, and never once longed for
the gold which was hers for so short a
while.</p>

<p class='c006'>By the way, I was nearly forgetting
to say that the pet poodle did not turn
into a live dog again. He remained a
golden one, and made an exceedingly
handsome ornament for the fireplace.</p>

  <h2 id='Princess' class='c004'>THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>There was once a Frog.</p>

<p class='c006'>He lay in a pool near the horse-pond
in the farmyard, behind the
King’s Castle. To look at, he was not
by any means a remarkable frog. He
was neither bigger nor smaller than
other frogs of his kind; neither was he
greener, browner, nor more yellow.
He certainly was a perfect swimmer,
and his croak was perhaps just a little
more musical than the croak of the
other frogs, but in other respects he
was exactly like them. He spent his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>days catching worms and flies, and
dodging ducks who were always on
the lookout to catch him. His was the
usual frog’s life—and yet, and yet he
was no ordinary frog.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c006'>There was once a Princess.</p>

<p class='c006'>She lived in the Castle beyond the
pool, on the other side of the horse-pond.
She was no ordinary Princess.
Princesses, of course, are always beautiful;
but this one was more beautiful
than any. Her hair was more golden
than real gold; her eyes as blue as an
eastern sky; her teeth as white as the
whitest of pearls, while her smile was
as sweet as an angel’s. She was as
good as she was beautiful.</p>

<p class='c006'>Indeed, she was no ordinary Princess.
She loved the world and everybody in
it. She loved her dear old father, the
King (she had no mother and brothers
and sisters to love, poor Princess); she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>loved all the King’s subjects, from the
oldest old man to the youngest new
baby, and she loved all animals—yes,
all animals, from the noble horses to—well,
even to the frogs in the pool
beyond the horse-pond, in the farmyard
at the back of the Castle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, the King was very rich, and
so his daughter had everything she
desired, and what she desired most
was the means to do good to others,
and to be able to care for all the
maimed and injured animals in her
father’s kingdom. She had comfortable
stables built for the poor old horses,
kennels for the poor old dogs, almshouses
for the poor old men and women,
and happy homes for homeless babies.
The Princess was the ministering angel
of the country.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
<img src='images/illus049.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the Castle itself she had aviaries
filled with beautiful birds, and aquariums
full of fish and all sorts of queer
animals, including
even a frog
with an injured
foot, that the
Princess herself
had found in
the pool in the
farmyard behind
her
father’s Castle.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>This was the Frog that was no ordinary
frog, except in appearance. He lived in
the Castle, and was happy; and his foot
got quite well, except when he hopped
he had a slight limp.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now, everything went happily until
the lovely Princess was eighteen years
old, and then something fearful happened.
A terrible and cruel war broke
out between the King, her father, and a
neighbouring Emperor, and alas! the
King got the worst of it. He lost
every battle from the very beginning;
town after town fell into the hands of
the enemy; the happy villages were
burnt down; the crops and the cattle
were seized, and the King and his
daughter sat in the Castle with only a
few soldiers to guard them, expecting
every moment the arrival of the Emperor’s
victorious army.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
<img src='images/illus051.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>They had no money—all their treasures
had been sold to pay for the
horrid war. The old men and women
were miserable in the almshouses; the
babies cried in their homes; the horses
and birds and fishes had been set free,
for there was no money with which to
buy them food, and there was misery
over all the land.
The poor Princess
had no pets except
one that had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>left behind in the aquarium—the Frog
that was no ordinary frog, and that had a
limp when he hopped, and whose croak
was rather more musical than the croak
of other frogs. Well, it came at last, the
Emperor’s conquering army, and it swept
all before it; the Castle was taken, and
the King and the Princess had only
just time to escape by the back door,
and through the farmyard by the pool,
near the horse-pond, and so on to the
woods, where they hid themselves from
their enemies. The Frog was with
them—yes, in a safety-matchbox, in the
Princess’s pocket. It was certainly not
comfortable there, but he preferred it to
being left behind in a castle filled with
strangers. The next day found the King
and his daughter miles away from their
old home, seated hand in hand upon a
bank, hungry and miserable. No one
would have taken them for a King and a
Princess, for he wore an ordinary felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>hat, instead of a crown,
and she wore nothing
on her head but her
own beautiful golden
hair, which was more
beautiful and brilliant than the finest
gold. Well, they went all that day
without anything to eat but berries, and
at night they slept in the woods again;
and so they journeyed on, more miserable
and hungry. The Frog, too, was
not very happy, and having the cramp
in his lame foot, kicked somewhat
vigorously in his matchbox, so that the
Princess heard him, and pitied him, and
determined to let him go when they
came to some water.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus053.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Now, they had not gone much farther
before they came to a pond, and here, I
think, comes the wonderful part of the
story. The Princess took the Frog
from the matchbox and held it for a
moment in her hand, and as she did so,
she burst into tears, and her tears fell
upon the little creature.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Alas!” she cried, “you are the last
of my poor pets I loved so dearly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Then there suddenly came a flash of
light, and a noise like terrible thunder,
and the King, in his fright, fell on his
back, while the Princess opened her dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>blue eyes
in wonder.
There stood before
her a handsome
Prince, who smiled
and held out his hands to her.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“The spell of a wicked fairy is
broken,” he said. “The Frog you took
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>from the pool was no ordinary frog—in
reality, he was an enchanted Prince;
your love for, and the tears that fell on
him, have restored him to his own form
again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come,” he continued, “we three
will go over those blue hills together, to
my lovely country. And you shall be my
Princess, and we will rule the land together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And so they went away, hand in
hand, the Princess between her father
and the Prince, and they went over
the blue hills to the most beautiful
country you can imagine. And then,
before long, the Princess built stables
and kennels for the old horses and poor
dogs, and almshouses for the old men
and old women, and houses for the
homeless babies; and she was never so
happy as when doing good to others,
and everybody loved her, for, truly, she
was the ministering angel of the land.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='Snowflakes' class='c004'>THE THREE SNOWFLAKES</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Once upon a time there were three
snowflakes, and they were called
Faith, Hope, and Charity. When I say
three snowflakes, I don’t quite mean
that, but three little girls dressed in
white, and looking like snow Princesses
as they trudged along across the white
covered country.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>They were the Earl’s daughters, and,
as I have just said, their names were
Faith, Hope, and Charity. I wonder
what the Earl would have called a
fourth daughter, supposing he had had
one.</p>

<p class='c006'>The three snowflakes lived at the
Castle, which was on a hillside, surrounded
by a beautiful park, and overlooking
the valley.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the summer it was a lovely valley,
with a river running through it, and
beautiful green woods coming down to
the edges of the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the winter had come it was
all white, except the river, which
looked grey in the distance. In one
corner of the valley lay the village,
and in the last cottage of the
village there lived a little girl called
Ruth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth was very poor, indeed, she
was so poor that she possessed nothing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>The tiny cottage she stood in had been
rented by her grandmother, and now
her grandmother was dead; the only
relation she had left in the world had
been taken from her.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>There was not a crumb of bread in
the cupboard, not a stick with which to
make a fire, not a penny in the girl’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>pocket, so no wonder she stood looking
out of the window with dismay in her
face.</p>

<p class='c006'>The window was a little open, and
through the opening came three flakes
of snow.</p>

<p class='c006'>They fell upon the brick floor and
melted slowly away.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/illus060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Ruth shuddered;
it was
the first snow
of the year, it
might mean
the beginning
of a long,
hard, cruel
winter.</p>

<p class='c006'>She shuddered
again,
and then of a
sudden knelt
on the brick
floor and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>clasped her hands in prayer, and this
showed she had Faith in her heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>And as she prayed the sun broke
through the snow clouds, and poured in
through the window, and shone on the
girl’s brown hair. She rose with a smile
on her lips and a light dancing in her
eyes, for there was Hope in her breast.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ruth opened the window and took in
the withered flowers on the sill.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor flowers,” she said, “you will
be warmer inside.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now this was Charity, for kindness
is Charity, and we can be kind even
to flowers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, of a sudden, there came shouts
of laughter from the lane without, and
the sound of merry voices; the door of
the cottage flew open, and in ran the
Earl’s daughters, the three snowflakes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Ruth,” said Charity, “we have
heard of your trouble, and our father
has sent us to help you.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
<img src='images/illus062.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>And Charity kissed Ruth on the
cheek.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you are to come and live in
the lodge by the gates,” said Faith,
putting her arms round the poor girl’s
waist, and leading her to the door of
the cottage.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And you are to be happy the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>year long,” cried Hope, clapping her
hands, and turning, she led the way,
skipping and laughing, up the lane.</p>

<p class='c006'>And so it happened that Ruth went
and lived in the lodge of the great
lord’s beautiful estate, and there she
may be living, contented and happy, to
this day.</p>
